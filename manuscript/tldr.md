# TL;DR

Here is a quick summary of the currently proposed organizational
structure for the Mozilla India community. If you are interested in
the full proposal, skip to the next chapter.

## Proposal summary

Have open, transparent, accountable teams where individual
contributors can work together with the highest amount of
flexibility. Adopt a participatory process that does not add excess
process overhead. Everyone is urged to take up the things they like
and work together with others, and in the process, improve the
structure itself.

Overall team composition consists of "Functional Teams" (with long
term focus) and "Focus Teams" (possibly cross-functional, with short
term focus on particular events/use cases). These teams are formed
around functional contribution areas, with a degree of alignment with
Mozilla's key concerns.

An overarching "Meta Team" glues things together and ensures smooth
function and cross-team collaboration. The teams are supported by
various infrastructure and communication channels.

There are also "Geographic Groups" that consist of Mozillians in
particular regions and help in discovering and connecting Mozillians
by location.

Ownership is on everyone for the roles they take up. Leadership is a
result of achieving expertise through constant practice and grows
organically.

Self-evaluation, backed by data, is done at every point to understand
effectiveness and impact of the community and its initiatives.

This is a constantly evolving, fluid and flexible structure. Nothing is
set in stone.
