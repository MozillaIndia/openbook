-# TL;DR

Here is a quick summary of the currently proposed organizational
structure for the Mozilla India community. If you are interested in
the full proposal, skip to the next chapter.

# Proposal summary

Have open, transparent, accountable teams with decentralized decision
making and utmost flexibility and adaptability in structure.

Overall team composition consists of "Functional Teams" (with long
term focus) and "Focus Teams" (possibly cross-functional, with short
term focus on particular events/use cases). An overarching "Meta Team"
glues things together and ensures smooth function and cross-team
collaboration. The teams are supported by various infrastructure and
communication channels.

Teams are formed around functional contribution areas, with a degree
of alignment with Mozilla's key concerns. Geographic representation is
ascertained by virtue of being present at a particular location.

Ownership is on everyone for the roles they take up. Leadership is a
result of achieving expertise through constant practice and grows
organically.

Continuous introspection and retrospection are used at every possible
instance to check the impact of every effort and to ascertain the
community health in general.

This is a constantly evolving, fluid and flexible structure. Everyone
is urged to take up the things they like and work together with
others, and in the process, improve the structure itself. Nothing is
set is stone.
