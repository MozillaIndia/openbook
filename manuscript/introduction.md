# About

This book serves as the canonical document for the organizational structure adopted by the [Mozilla India](http://mozillaindia.org) community.

It is [collaboratively written](https://github.com/MozillaIndia/openbook) by [Mozillians](http://mozillians.org/). The Meta Team of Mozilla India serve as its editors and maintainers.

## A bit of history

This book was put into place right after the Mozilla India Meetup at Pune in August, 2016, to help document the outcome of the efforts to restructure the Mozilla India.
