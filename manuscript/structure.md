# Mozilla India Restructure Proposal

Status: Draft v0.2.0 - RFC \\
Date: August 28, 2016

## Vision for the community

**Enable the community to uphold the Mozilla mission at any scale, while remaining relevant to individual contributors.**

## Fundamental principles to help achieve the vision

- Maintain transparency of operations (ensures openness)
- Invite participation explicitly (includes trust-first model)
- Decentralize decision making
- Maintain ubiquity of communications
- Ensure accountability through clear metrics and documentation of actions and decisions.
- Use flexible and adaptive structure which keeps on improving itself through constant feedback and evaluation.

### FAQ

Q: What do you mean by transparency? \\
A: Talk and work in the open

Q: What do you mean by being explicit about invitation? \\
A: Explicitly welcome contributions by documenting things which will make onboarding simpler. Announce on channels where people are listening.

Q: What does decentralized decision making mean in this context? \\
A: No central person for making any decisions related to the team or the larger community.

Q: What does ubiquity mean here? \\
A: Present everywhere, on the channels that are decided to be the primary communication channels of the entire community.


### Code of Conduct

The community code of conduct will adopt the very same [Mozilla's up-to-date CoC](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).

## Organizational Structure

### Basics

- Any non-general role will be shared by 2 persons to ensure redundancy of human resources and contingency plan.

- Each team in the following structure tree will have a role of facilitator (shared by 2 people)
  - They work as the communication interface for the team with the outside world and the meta team
  - They work as the arbitrators to help finalize team decisions (and save from it needing to bubble up to meta team)
  - They ensure execution of the undertaken responsibilities of the team and publish activity reports publicly and to the overseeing body
  - In any case either of the facilitators discontinues or becomes unavailable for the role, a second facilitator is chosen from the team within a preset timeout
  - Any concern about the team's’ health, deliverable, execution should be resolved by the facilitators, and to be flagged to the overseeing team if failed within preset timeout
  - Any concern about peer teams' health, operation, and execution should also be noted, reviewed and resolved OR flagged to the common overseeing team, as soon as observed

- Each team can have their own preferred internal communication channels, but they would have to conform to the community preferred channels to document, broadcast and publish activity reports

- Teams need to be formed with clear objectives.

- While choosing team members, teams should look out for the best suited, capable and passionate individuals who are willing to pursue the objectives of the team.

- Community's operation process will follow a meritocratic processes instead of a democratic process.

- Every part of the community should have well documented and discoverable waypoints/pathways

- Self-checks at any level and at any given time is encouraged, and decided resolution is applied to evolve the community structure on the fly.

- Every entity (individual or team) in the community starts with a preset level of trust
- The level of trust allows for different level of responsibilities to be undertaken
- The trust level can be gained or lost, based on the activities/track-records


### FAQ

A: What are self-checks? \\
Q: Self-evaluation, which includes introspection (analyze your own ideas and thoughts) and retrospection (analyze the past and identify things which can be improved). This can be done both for yourself or for a team or, even, for the larger community.

## Hierarchy

### Meta Team

- Core of the community identity
- Experience based membership
- Sets goals, allocates resources
- Oversees community operations
- Resolves conflicts and grievances
- Is accountable to the community through a self-evaluation report at least once every 6 months.

### Functional Teams

- Persistent teams
- Strategic objectives
- Limited memberships
- Responsible for functional growth
- Overseen by Meta Team, peer reviewed by other functional teams

### Focus Teams

- Temporary teams
- Tactical objectives
- Scalable Memberships
- Responsible for campaign deliverables
- Overseen by participating functional teams

### Geographic Groups

- Persistent group
- Core purpose is to enable functions that benefit from geographic coordination
- Membership is by virtue of someone’s presence in that geographic area, and it will be seamless for any person to move to a new geographical group
- Supported by Meta Team


## Communications and PR

A set of centralized communication media will be necessary for the community's internal discussions and external outreach. The goal of such a communication system is to encourage visibility of information while remaining relevant for focused group discussions.

- Discourse for discussions
  - Threaded, searchable, near-real-time
  - Can be piped to our existing community-india mailing list.
  - Sub-categories can help in grouping discussions

- Telegram for real-time discussions
  - Real-time discussions that do not need to be threaded.

- Wiki for canonical resources
  - collaboratively editable, references, non-real-time
  - Can use wiki.mozilla.org/India

- Blog.MozillaIndia
  - PR, outreach, announcements

- Social media
  - PR and engagement - outreach, announcements

### Infrastructure accesses required

- DNS & Email Liaisons
- Web server access
- Discourse admins
- Mailing list admins
- Telegram admins
- Blog admins
- Wiki admins
- Social network admins
- Facebook groups and pages
- Twitter access
- YouTube admins
- Instagram access
- Bugzilla admins
- Github organization access groups

## Recognition

- Individual activity metrics, funneled from various resources will be listed publicly and will serve as the primary medium of recognition.
- This process will require gradual improvement to be more concise as more and more activity facets are discovered and added in.
- Individual rewards will be for Mozilla to distribute; the local community will only ensure availability of the data for decision making.

## Self-checks, grievances and arbitration

- Self-checks can happen in any level, by anyone, by using data and activity log with references.
- For any issue i.e. coming from the self-checks should be raised to the concerned bodies.
- Failing to resolve any issue flagged at any level should be documented and escalated.

***

- There will be different ways to put forward a grievance for resolution, by different order of anonymity.
- Grievances (breaking of CoC, inter-personal discomfort, reporting peers/processes etc) has to be directly escalated to the meta team.
- The lack of escalation steps is there to ensure homogeneous treatments for the issues raised, and not bottleneck at any steps or go unresolved.

***

- Arbitration process for any conflict should follow a reason and argument based process.
- Arbitration process should only come into effect if the members of a team fail to resolve a conflict.
- Arbitration process should ensure the vision and fundamental principles in order to achieve appropriate resolution.
- At any step/team if the arbitration process fails to resolve, it is then immediately escalated to the overseeing team to take up.
